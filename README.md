# FandomFixed
Adblock/uBlock Origin filter to remove all annoyances and debloat Fandom.com wikis. Hides the sidebar, comments, related posts, unrelated links, suggestions and more. Works best with uBlock Origin on Firefox.
The sidebars are all removed, with the article taking up more space.

# This filter is primarily for readers!
This removes a ton of features that the general public who just wants to read articles doesn't need comments, editing, related articles, Fandom.com news, and more. I don't know how well this works for editing. Please report any bugs when editing or moderating. I don't have a Fandom account anymore so I can't test any signed in pages unfortunately.

# Disabled "features"
Comments, social media share links, discussion topics, posting, Discord invitation popups (on certain wikis), suggested Wikis, partnered wikis, the righthand side popular pages and images, the bottom random articles, the left hand sidebar, the bottom TikTok popups, videos, and more.

# How to install
To install, download and install an ad-blocking extension that supports custom ad lists and/or importing ad lists. I suggest uBlock Origin, which works best on Firefox. https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock
To install this filter specifically on uBlock Origin, click on the uBlock Origin badge, and go to settings. Go to filter lists, scroll down, import, and paste in the URL https://www.squabbled.net/paste/fandomfixeduBlockOrigin.txt
Alternatively, you can manually copy the uBlock.txt file into your "My Filters" tab in settings.

# FAQs
Q: I got the new Fandom layout, and everything looks all messed up! 

A: Don't panic. Click uBO on the top right hand corner of your browser, go to settings > filter lists > update now. If that doesn't work, scroll down to the area where you've added the list, and click the "clock" icon to force an update.

Q: I'm just getting a blank white page!

A: The Fandom.com homepage doesn't work with this script enabled, mainly because of how extremely bloated it is. If you want to search for a particular wiki, enter site:fandom.com into your search engine of choice, and the search bar on individual wikis should work.

Q: I can't use uBO or other ad-blocking software, can I still enjoy a debloated Fandom experience?

A: Yes. BreezeWiki is the same premise as this list, albeit without using the actual Fandom website. A popular method to access BreezeWiki is to add anti to fandom.com so that the URL becomes antifandom.com. For example, https://prepaid-data-sim-card.fandom.com/wiki/Prepaid_SIM_with_data becomes https://prepaid-data-sim-card.antifandom.com/wiki/Prepaid_SIM_with_data. Alternatively, the Indie Wiki Buddy (getindie.wiki) does this automatically, and if the .fandom.com wiki is discontinued, automatically takes you to the newest wiki.

Q: Does this list work with Pi-Hole?

A: No. You need ad-blocking software such as uBlock Origin to use this list.
